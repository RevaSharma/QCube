QuestionPaper_Generator

This software is a question paper generator. It replaces the manual work done by teachers to generate the desired test papers by providing a user friendly interface with multiple options. It will include a database of questions from past Cambridge papers, sorted on the basis of paper type (paper 1 or 2), topic and marks. The program will allow the teacher to login with relevant details and insert the paper type, questions from relevant topics, total marks and time allotted for the test. On the basis of this feed, relevant questions will be displayed on the screen from which the teacher can shortlist the ones they want to include in the test paper. These questions will get compiled into a word document in a predetermined format. The user will have the option to review and modify the questions and finally there will be an option to print the test paper. If you login as an admin, you have the ability to populate the database, edit and delete questions from it, etc.
